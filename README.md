**How did i approach this task?**

1. first of all I create a basic format of translator like input boxs and icons that are required for translator tools
2. After that i give them css and make them presentable and aligned. In icons give them some transitions for increasing the user experience.
3. After the designing of the website i create to script file one for the countries and another for scripting the website.
4. In scripting file first of all i create all variables to access the elements of index file
5. Than using foreach methods i add of the options of the languages and also set the default value of the option.
6. After that  is use Eventlistener and use the api key to translate the text that are written in textarea and fetch the translated text and paste it in the tranlated textarea
7. After that i add the foreach and eventlistener on icons and make them functional.


**What were the challenges i faced?**
1. I faced problem in give them css and making it reponsives.
2. Then i faced problems in set api key and fetching the tranlated text
3. The last problems faced in icon speaker section in some languages speaker icon is not working and it not resolve yet.
